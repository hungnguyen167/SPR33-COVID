# SPR33-COVID
This is the Online Appendix for the SPR33 article by Nguyen, Breznau, and Heukamp 2020 (forthcoming)

# Instructions:
- First, make sure you open the SPR33.Rproj file before working with data (so the working directory is set to the Github folder). 
- Data files are in the "data" folder. Data sources are cited in the main Rmd file: SPR33-COVID.Rmd.
- Make sure you install all packages Rstudio asks for before running the code chunks.
- Tables are produced in the Markdown environment (can be exported to HTML), figures are saved to the "results" folder.
